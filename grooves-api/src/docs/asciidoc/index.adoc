== How Grooves solves it

Grooves assumes nothing about your persistence framework or whether you're building a webapp or a batch application.
Grooves only offers some tools to help you build your own event sourced system.

* Interfaces for the Aggregate, Event (and its special subtypes) and Snapshot.
* A set of interfaces with default methods that help you write queries.
* _If you're using groovy_, annotations to mark these and AST Transformations to ensure all event types are covered in a Query implementation.

This allows you to use Grooves with a lot of different frameworks.
There are examples in the repository for some options you could use.
